### Description
This was my first project working withh Bootstrap. Its a Static web page that is designed to be repsonsive to screen sizes with the help of Bootstrap's grid system. Text styling, and the photos, and a form cards are also created with bootstrap's classes in this project. The Webpage is just informative about the symbols the represent Autism Spectrum Disorder. It explains the preferred symbol to be used by the Autistic community. The was my second full web page I created and It will always be special to me because my son is in the Autsim spectrum so representing and being a voice/advocate for that community is something that means a lot to me.

I plan on going back and adding a navigation bar dynamically using JavaScript that appears or disappears depending on whether or not the user is scrolling.
